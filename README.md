# Verbena's NeoVim configs

This is my (very) basic NeoVim configurations, it has the minimum I need to do what I need

It's being kept here so I don't need to redo these anytime soon, you can use it whichever way as per the MIT license, I don't mind.

# What does it have?

Currently:

telescope.nvim + telescope-fzf-native.nvim,
neo-tree.nvim,
nvim-treesitter,
mason-lspconfig.nvim,
nvim-colorizer,
vim-slint,
lualine.nvim,
barbar.nvim,
mini.nvim,
snacks.nvim,
nvim-dev-icons,

\+ their dependencies

It also has a couple shortcuts I find most comfortable, and not really any more, + it is pre-configured to install the treesitter parsers and mason LSPs I tend to use the most.

If you plan to use it, I would recommend checking out the init.lua, lua/plugins/treesitter.lua and lua/plugins/mason.lua
